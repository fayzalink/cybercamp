    <h1>the story in the book</h1>
    <h2>chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk. lying between the copies of<1>Nature
        </1>
        <1>New scientists</1>. and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in was a well thumbed copy of
        <cite> on The road </cite>. it had been molly's favorite book since college. and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.<P>
        </P>She had spent the last ten years in this room.
        sitting under a poster with an oscar wilde quote proclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have
            nothing better to do</q>. although many considered her pioneering work. unraveling the secrets of the
        llama<abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. to be an outstanding achievement, molly <em>did</em> think
        she had some thing better to do.
